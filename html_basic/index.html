    <p>A sorting algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements as per the comparison operator on the element. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure. Mainly there are five basic algorithms used and you can derive multiple algorithms using these basic algorithms. Each of these algorithms has some pros and cons and can be chosen effectively depending on the size of data to be handled.</p>
